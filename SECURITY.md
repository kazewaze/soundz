# Security Policy

If you Discover a Security Vulnerability, Please Email me at kazewaze.dev@gmail.com

We ask that you:
- Do not Disclose it Publicly
- Give me Time to Investigate and Fix the Issue

I will credit responsible disclosures in our Hall of Fame (Yes, I will create a dedicated page on the main site just for this heroic occassion).
